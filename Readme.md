# Goals
The main goal for this language is to allow the rapid prototyping akin to dynamically
and weakly typed languages like ECMAScript, while allowing to upgrade the prototype
to a proper program with the safety of static and strongly typed languages like C#.
It also should allow for a unified syntactical interface for blocking and non blocking code
– making refactoring painless and easy.

# The Essence
* Extensibility is better than completeness.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Creating correct code must be enjoyable.
* Prototyping must be fast – thus refactoring must be painless.
* Readability counts.
* There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it.
* Practicality beats purity.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Clever is seldom good.
