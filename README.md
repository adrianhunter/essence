# Goals
The main goal for this language is to allow the rapid prototyping development of dynamically and weakly typed languages like ECMAScript,
while allowing to upgrade the prototype to a proper program with the safety and performance of static and strongly typed languages like C#.

# The essence of Essence
	Extensibility is better than completeness.
	Explicit is better than implicit.
	Readability counts.
	There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.
	Practicality beats purity.
	Simple is better than complex.
	Complex is better than complicated.
	Beautiful is better than ugly.
	Clever is seldom good.
	Before it is released, it has to be typed.
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it may be a bad idea.
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.



# Features
* Unified, Static and Dynamic Structural Typing
* Modules & Namespaces
* Interfaces | Protocols
	* with implicit Interface satisfaction
* Generics
* Named Parameters - Maybe enforced?
* Method Overloading
	* Optional Parameters - maybe 0/nil-initialized values like Go?
* First class functions
* Built-in Types - could those be implemented in a standard library satisfactory?
	* Array - Size and type limited at initialization
	* List - dynamic size
	* Tuple - immutable ?
	* Named Tuple - immutable ?
